Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
You can only use putchar twice in your code
All your code should be in the main function
